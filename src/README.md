The p5.js source code is organized into subdirectories which are roughly conceptually equivalent to third-party addons, except that these "addons" are actually just shipped as part of the p5.js library because the functionality they provide is so useful and central to p5's goal of building art projects for the web.

The `src/core` directory is the primary exception to this. It contains most of the internal logic of p5.js â€” the code which orchestrates everything else. It is possible to create optimized minimalist [custom builds](/developer_docs/custom_p5_build.md) of the p5.js library which only include specific desired modules. In such a custom build, the contents of the core directory would be the only hard requirement, and everything else would be optional.

The `app.js` file is simply an index of all the other modules which exports the p5 constructor function.
